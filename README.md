## 📌 Why Animations Matter

Animations make web interfaces feel alive and engaging. They help guide user focus, add polish, and improve UX when used thoughtfully. Keep performance in mind — animating certain properties like transform and opacity is smoother and more efficient than forcing layout recalculations.

## 🚧 Best Practices (Pro Tips)

1. ✨ Optimize performance
Focus on properties like transform and opacity — they’re GPU‑accelerated and deliver smoother animations.

2. 🧠 Stay subtle
Overused animations can distract users. Use them to enhance clarity, not overwhelm.

3. ♿ Respect motion preferences
Consider adding @media (prefers‑reduced‑motion) styles for users who prefer minimal movement.
